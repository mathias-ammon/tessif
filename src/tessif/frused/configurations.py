"""
:mod:`~tessif.frused.configurations` is a :mod:`tessif` subpackage aggregating
simulation parameters, used naming and unit conventions as well as some
logging behavior.

It serves as main reference point for adjusting tessif's simulative and
parsing behavior.

node_uid_style = 'name'
"""
Switch for tweaking internal node uid representation style.

Useful for conveniently changing internal mapping behaviour. Must be one of
:attr:`~tessif.frused.namedtuples.node_uid_styles`.

Somehting like ``name`` allows for quick and intuitive node accessing while
sacrificing the possibility of 2 nodes having the same
:paramref:`~tessif.frused.namedtuples.uid.name`.

``qualname`` on the other hand maps everything to the fully qualified name.
Meaning only ever the full combination of all
:class:`~tessif.frused.namedtuples.uid` attributes has to be unique per
energy system.

.. warning::

    Tessif's doctests assumes ``node_uid_style = 'name'`` which is the most
    basic and intuitive way of mapping nodes. Designed for the use of
    relatively small energy systems (what ever that means).

For a list of available styles and their key (the string set to
:attr:`node_uid_style`) see :attr:`tessif.frused.namedtuples.node_uid_styles`.
